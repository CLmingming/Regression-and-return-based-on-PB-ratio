## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives
This project investigates two critical aspects of China's A-share market:
1. **Valuation Drivers Analysis**  
   Identify how fundamental metrics (ROE-TTM, stock volatility) explain cross-sectional variations in P/B ratios through multivariate regression.

2. **Dynamic Portfolio Strategy**  
   Construct and backtest decile portfolios based on P/B ratios to examine the relationship between valuation levels and subsequent returns.
